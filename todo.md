
Derived Stats: 
- When you lose Humanity points you will sometimes have to lower your EMP Statistic. This happens every time the tens place of your Humanity value is lowered. For instance, a Character with 44 Humanity has an EMP of 4 until their Humanity is lowered to 39, at which point their EMP lowers to 3
- raising humanity with therapy
- calculate seriously wounded/death based on HP remaining
- Calculate death save

Role Abilities:

- Add levels for Role abilities
- Sort out data structure in roles.json (it's probably going to be messy no matter what since the charater abilities work in very different ways depending on character type)

Modal: 
- sort out small screen display
- stop show button and icon being hidden beneath the top of the modal container (see emp modal)
- hide scrollbar (is this possible with overflow: scroll?)
